# Sound Wave Analysis Project

This project involves working with sound waves as datatypes, representing them in a computer, and performing various operations. Key components include adding echoes, implementing a high-pass filter, supporting the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), comparing sound waves, and grouping music by structural similarity. The project also emphasizes robust testing strategies and clear method specifications.

## Understanding Sound Waves

Sound waves are mechanical pressure waves propagating through mediums like air, produced by vibrating objects. These waves can be visualized as either longitudinal or transverse waves, helping conceptualize their nature.

### Sound as a Signal

Sound waves have spatial and temporal dimensions but are often visualized with time as the single independent variable. This simplification allows us to treat sound experienced at a single point as a time-varying physical signal, encoding information.

## Microphones and Sound Transformation

Microphones convert physical sound waves into electrical signals, allowing their processing through either analog circuits or digital computers.

### Musical Notes

Musical notes are sinusoidal waves with specific frequencies. They can be visualized and conceptualized as individual or composite sinusoidal waves.

## Digital Audio

Sound waves can be represented as arrays of amplitude values, digitally sampled at a specific rate (e.g., 44,100 samples per second). This digital representation enables manipulation and processing of the sound as digital audio.

## Project Components

### Getting Started

Teams will work collaboratively using a GitHub Classroom repository to develop the project.

### The `SoundWave` Datatype

Implementation of `SoundWave` datatype, allowing creation from MP3 files, sinusoidal, square, and triangular waves descriptions.

### Operations on Sound Waves

Operations include appending and superimposing waves, adding echoes, and volume adjustments. All operations must ensure values stay within the [-1, +1] range.

### Working with Multiple Audio Waves

This involves searching for patterns within waves, defining and computing wave similarity, and identifying occurrences of one wave within another.

### Implementing Audio Filters

Implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for sound waves, identifying frequency components of the highest amplitude, and implementing low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters.

## Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive approach to understanding and manipulating sound waves, emphasizing digital representation, signal processing, and algorithmic operations on audio data.
